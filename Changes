      Even more documentation completed.  Fixed an egregious flaw found in
      two methods:
         Class::OOorNO::myargs()
         Class::OOorNO::myself()

      A little more documentation completed.  Completed move to namespace
      Class::OOorNO from the errantly pre-assigned root namespace of OOorNO.

      Much documentation has been added.  Various methods have been corrected
      to use a much stricter policy for determining whether or not a given
      method was called in OO or procedural style.  More in-depth discussion
      regarding this issue is covered in the new documentation.

      Method Class::OOorNO::shave_opts() now uses UNIVERSAL::isa() rather
      than CORE::ref() to check for an array ref as it should have in the
      beginning.
